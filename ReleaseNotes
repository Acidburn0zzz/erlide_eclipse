This is the first release targeting Eclipse 3.4. 

The big news is that we are now including *experimental* Wrangler 
refactoring support! György Orosz has put together the required Eclipse 
scaffolding and we will appreciate all the feedback we can get. 

Otherwise, there are some bugs that have been fixed, see the ChangeLog 
for details.

Enjoy!
/Vlad, Jakob and György
