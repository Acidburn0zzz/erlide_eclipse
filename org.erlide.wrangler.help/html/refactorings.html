	<h1>Refactorings</h1>
	<h2><a name="Rename variable">Rename variable</a></h2>
		Rename a variable with a new name supplied by the user.
		<p> This refactoring has a local effect, i.e., it only affects the function clause 
		in which the refactoring is initialised.</p>
		
		<p> The following <em> side-conditions </em> (or <em>pre-conditions</em>) apply to this refactoring: </p>
		<ul>
		<li> The new variable name should not conflict with any of the declared variable names in the same scope;</li>
		<li> The new variable name should not shadow any of the existing variables in the outer scopes, 
		or be shadowed by any of existing variables in the inner scopes, i.e., renaming to the new name 
		should not change the semantics of the program.</li>
		</ul>
		<p> <b>Usage:</b> to apply this refactoring, point the cursor to any occurrence of this variable, then select
		<em> Rename Variable... </em> from the <em> Refactor </em>menu, after that, 
		Wrangler will ask you for the new name.</p>
		<p><b>Shortcut:</b></p><code> SHIFT+ALT+R V </code>
		
	<h2><a name="Rename function">Rename function</a></h2>
		Rename a function with a new name supplied by the user.
		<p> When renaming an exported function, this refactoring has a global effect, that is, 
		it affects all those modules in which this function is imported/used.</p>
		
		<p> The following <em> side-conditions </em> (or <em>pre-conditions </em>}  apply to this refactoring:</p>
		<ul>
		<li> The new function name should not cause confliction with any of the functions which are in scope in the 
		current module;</li>
		<li> In the case that the function to be renamed is imported by another module, the new function name (with the same 
		arity) should not be already in scope (either defined or imported) in that module. </li>
		</ul>
		<p> <b>Usage:</b> to apply this refactoring, point the cursor to any occurrence of this 
		function name, then select <em> Rename Function... </em> from the <em> Refactor </em> menu, 
		after that, Wrangler will ask you for the function"s new name.</p>
		<p><b>Shortcut:</b></p><code> SHIFT+ALT+R F </code>
		
	<h2><a name="Rename module">Rename module</a></h2>
		Rename a module with a new name supplied by the user.
		<p> This refactoring affects all those modules in which the module name is used.</p>
		
	 	<p>The following <em> side-conditions </em> apply to this refactoring:</p>
	 	<ul>
		<li> The new module name should not have been used as a module name in the program under consideration. </li>
		<li> This refactoring assume that the file basename is always the same as the module name, therefore this 
	 	refactoring changes the filename as well. </li>
	 	</ul>
		<p> <b>Usage:</b> to apply this refactoring, point the cursor anywhere in the module to be renamed, then select 
		<em> Rename Module... </em> from the <em> Refactor </em> menu, after that, the refactorer will prompt to enter 
		the new module name.</p>
		<p><b>Shortcut:</b></p><code> SHIFT+ALT+R M </code>
	
	<h2><a name="Move function">Move function</a></h2>
		Move a function definition from its current module to another.
		<p> This refactoring has a global effect, i.e., it affects all the modules - in the project - in which 
		the function is imported/used.</p>
		
		<p> This refactoring assumes that an Erlang module name always matches its file name.</p>
		
		<p> Suppose we move function <em> foo/n </em> from its current module <em> M </em> 
		to module <em> N </em>, then the following <em> side-conditions </em> apply to 
		this refactoring:</p> 
		<ul>
		<li> If <em> foo/n </em> is already in scope in module <em> N </em>, then its defining 
		module should be  <em> M </em>.</li>
		<li> Function <em> foo/n </em> should not contain any uses of <em> implicit fun expressions </em> (Note: move a 
		collection of functions together to another module will be supported by another refactoring).</li>
		</ul>
		<p> <b>Usage</b>: to apply this refactoring, point the cursor at the function definition, then 
		select <em> Move function...</em> from the <em> Refactor </em> menu, 
		Wrangler will ask you to select one of the existing modules. </p>
		<p><b>Shortcut:</b></p><code> SHIFT+ALT+M </code>
	
	<h2><a name="Fold expression">Fold expression</a></h2>
		Fold expressions against a function definition.
		<p>This refactoring replaces instances of the right-hand side of a function clause definition by
		the corresponding left-hand side with necessary parameter substitutions.</p>
		
		<p> In the case that a candidate expression/expression sequence  needs to export some variables which 
		are used by the code following code, that expression/expression sequence will be replaced by a match 
		expression, whose left-hand side it the exported variable(s), and right-hand side is the function
		application.</p>
		
		<p> This refactoring does not support folding against function clauses with guard expressions, or 
		function clauses with complex formal parameters, such as tuples, lists, or records. </p>
		
		<p> <b>Usage</b>: first point the cursor to the function clause against which expressions will be 
		folded if the function is defined in the current module, then select <em> Fold expression... </em> 
		from the <em> Refactor </em> menu; after that Wrangler will search the current module for expressions 
		which are instances of the right-hand side of the selected function clause.</p>
		
		<p> If no candidate expression has been found, a message will be given, and the refactoring 
		finishes; otherwise you a wizard window appears and you can select those expressions which would like to be folded.
		For the smarter usage in this stage of the process moving the cursor above the selectable expressions - in the dialog window - 
		they are highlighted in the background on by one.</p>
	
	<h2><a name="Function extraction">Function extraction</a></h2>
		Introduce a new function to represent an expression or expression sequence.
		<p> This refactoring allows the user to introduce a new function to represent a selected expression or expression 
		sequence, and replace the selected code with a call to the new function.  Free variables
		within the selected code become the formal parameters of the function definition.</p>
		<p>	<b>Usage</b>: highlight the expression/expression sequence of interest, then selected the <em>Function extraction...</em> 
		from the <em>Refactor</em> menu, Wrangler will then ask you for the new function name.
		</p>
	
	<h2><a name="Generalise function">Generalise function</a></h2>
		<p>Generalise a function definition by selecting a sub-expression of its right-hand 
		side and making this the value of a new argument added to the definition of the function. 
		The sub-expression becomes the actual parameter at the call sites. </p>
		
		<p> Here is an example of generalisation, in which the function <code> add_one </code> defined 
		on the left-hand side is generalised on the expression <code> 1 </code>, and the result is 
		shown on the right-hand side.</p> 
		<pre><code>	
```    -module (test).                          -module (test). 
       -export([f/1]).                          -export([f/1]).
   
       add_one ([H|T]) ->                       add_one (N, [H|T]) ->
          [H+1 | add_one(T)];                      [H+N | add_one(N,T)];
       add_one ([]) -> [].                      add_one (N, []) -> [].

       f(X) -> add_one(X).                      f(X) -> add_one(1,X)
''' 
		</code></pre>
		
		<p> In the case that the selected expression has a side-effect, the refactorer will wrap this expression 
		in an function expression before passing it as the actual parameter to the call-sites. This is illustrated 
		in the following example, in which function <code>repeat/1</code> is generalised on the expression 
		<code>io:format("Hello\n")</code>.</p>
		<pre><code>
```    -module (test).                          -module (test).                          
       -export([f/0]).                          -export([f/0]).

       repeat(0) -> ok;                         repeat(A, 0) -> ok;
       repeat(N) ->                             repeat(A, N) ->
          io:format("Hello\n"),                    A( ),
       repeat(N-1).                             repeat(A,N-1).

       f() -> repeat(5).                        f( ) -> 
                                                   repeat (fun( )->io:format ("Hello\n") end, 5).
'''
		</code></pre>
		
		<p> This refactoring <em>only </em> affects the module in which the refactoring is initialised. In the case that 
		the generalised function is exported by the module, an auxiliary function will be created 
		to wrap the generalised function up, so that the module's interface is not changed.
		</p>
		<p> The following <em> side-conditions </em> apply to this refactoring:</p>
		<ul>
		<li> Suppose the function to be generalised is <code>foo/n </code>, then <code>foo/n+1</code> should not  
		be in scope before the generalisation;</li>
		<li> The new parameter name provided by the user should not conflict with the existing parameters or
		change the semantics of the function to be generalised. </li>
		</ul>
		<p> <b>Usage</b>: to apply this refactoring, highlight the expression first, then  select 
		<em> Generalise function... </em> from the <em>Refactor</em> menu, after 
		that the refactorer will ask for the new name. </p>

	
	<h2><a name="Tuple function parameters">Tuple function parameters</a></h2>
		Turn some consecutive parameters of a function into a tuple parameter.
		<p>When the function under consideration is exported by the module where it is defined, 
		this refactoring has a global effect. </p>
		
		<p> Suppose the new function after refactoring is <code>f/n</code>, then the following <em> side-conditions </em> apply:</p>
		<ul>
		<li> <code> f/n</code> should not cause confliction with any of the functions which are in scope in the 
		current module;</li>
		<li> In the case that the function is imported by another module, then <code>f/n</code> 
		should not be already in scope (either defined or imported) in that module. </li>
		</ul>
		<p> <b>Usage</b>: to apply this refactoring, point the cursor to the parameter which is going to be the first 
		element of the tuple, then select <em> Tuple function parameters... </em> from the <em> Refactor </em> menu, 
		after that, Wrangler will ask you to enter the number of parameters to include into the tuple.
		</p>
		
	<h2><a name="Search expression">Search expression</a></h2>
	Search for clones of an expression/expression sequence selected in the current file.
 
		<p> This functionality allows searching for clones of a selected expression or expression 
		sequence.  The found clones are syntactically identical to the code fragment selected  after consistent renaming of variables, 
		except for variations in literals, layout and comments. 
		</p>
		<p> When the selected code contains multiple, but non-continuous sequence of, expressions, the first
		continuous sequence of expressions is taken as the user-selected expression. A continuous sequence of
		expressions is a sequence of expressions separated by ','. </p>
		Usage: highlight the expression/expression sequence of interest, then selected  <em>Search expression...</em> from 
		the <em> Refactor </em> menu. 
		<p>Then the 'Duplicated code' view appears in the bottom of the workbench, where double clicking on the found expressions 
		results to highlightion of the according code part in the editor.
	
	<h2><a name="Duplicated code detection">Duplicated code detection</a></h2>
	A duplicated code detector that works with multiple Erlang modules as well.	
		<p> This function reports duplicated code fragments found in the current Erlang module (if selected, then in the project), it does 
		not remove those code clones though. The user will be prompted for three parameters: the minimum number of 
		tokens a cloned code fragment should have, the minimum number of times a code fragment appears in the program and where to detect (current module/project). 
		</p>
		<p> The current version of the duplicated code detector reports clones that are syntactically 
		identical after consistent renaming of variables, except for variations in literals, layout and comments.
		</p>
		<p>
		Usage: simply select the  <em> Detect duplicated code  </em> from the <em>Refactor</em> menu, 
		then an input dialog appears which is for typing the necessary parameters. Finally the 'Duplicated code' view appears in the bottom of the workbench, where double clicking on the found expressions 
		results to highlightion of the according code part in the editor. Results are grouped by duplications and modules.
		</p>
	<h2><a name="Rename process">Rename process</a></h2>
	Rename a registered process with a new name supplied by the user.
		<p> To apply this refactoring, point the cursor to the process name, then select
		<em>Rename process</em> from the  <em>Refactor</em> menu, after that, Wrangler will prompt
		to enter the new process name.
		</p>
		<p> This refactoring has a global effect, i.e. it needs to check the whole program for places where the 
		original process name is used.
		</p>
		<p> The following <em> side-conditions </em> apply to this refactoring:
		<ul>
			<li> The new process name should not be the atom 'undefined' </li>
			<li> The new process name should not have been used as a process name in the program under consideration.  </li>
			<li> Since there are some cases where Wrangler cannot infer whether an atom represents a process name or not, for example, 
			a process name in a message, it would be help the refactoring process to select the process name from expressions, such as 
			registration expressions, where it is easier for Wrangler to infer that the atom is a process name.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	<h2><a name="Function to process">Function to process</a></h2>
	Turn a function into a server process.
		<p>This refactoring turns a function into a server process, and all the function calls to this function into process communication.
		Turning a function into a server process provides potential for memorisation of calculated values, adding states to the process, etc.
		</p>
		<p> The following example shows the application of this refactoring to the function <code>f/2</code> on the 
		left-hand side, and the result is shown on the right-hand side.</p><p>
		<pre><code>

``` f(add,X,Y) -> X +Y;                        f_rpc(RegName, Request) ->                  
    f(sub,X,Y) -> X - Y.                            Fun = fun() ->
                                                                try

                                                                end
                                                          end,
                                                    Spawn(Fun),
                                                    RegName ! {self(), Request},
                                                    receive {RegName, Response} -> Response end.

                                                f() ->
                                                  receive
                                                     {From, {add, X, Y}} -> From ! {f, X + Y}, f();
                                                     {From, {sub, X, Y}} -> From ! {f, X - Y}, f()
                                                  end.

                                               g(X, Y) ->
                                                  f_rpc(f, {add, X, Y}) * f_rpc(f, {sub, X, Y}).

		</p>The following side-conditions apply to this refactoring:<p>
		<ul>
			<li> The process name provided by the user should be lexically legal, and not conflict with existing process names. </li>   
			<li> The function should not be a recursive function, either directly or indirectly. </li>
			<li> The current function or functions called by this function should not register the <code>Pid</code> returned by <code>self()</code>. </li>

		Wrangler generates the new function name and the rpc function name automatically, but the user could always rename it afterwards.
		Suppose the original function is <code>f/n</code>, then the new function name would be <code>f/0</code> and the <code>rpc</code>

		name where <code>i</code> is a smallest number that makes the name fresh.
		</p>
		<p> To apply this refactoring, point the cursor to the function of interest, then select 
		<em>Convert Function to Process</em> from the <em>Refactor</em> menu, after that, Wrangler will prompt 
		 to enter the process registration name.
