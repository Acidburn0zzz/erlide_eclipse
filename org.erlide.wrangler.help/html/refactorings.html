	<h1>Refactorings</h1>
	<h2><a name="Rename variable">Rename variable</a></h2>
		Rename a variable with a new name supplied by the user.
		<p> This refactoring has a local effect, i.e., it only affects the function clause 
		in which the refactoring is initialised.</p>
		
		<p> The following <em> side-conditions </em> (or <em>pre-conditions</em>) apply to this refactoring: </p>
		<ul>
		<li> The new variable name should not conflict with any of the declared variable names in the same scope;</li>
		<li> The new variable name should not shadow any of the existing variables in the outer scopes, 
		or be shadowed by any of existing variables in the inner scopes, i.e., renaming to the new name 
		should not change the semantics of the program.</li>
		</ul>
		<p> <b>Usage:</b> to apply this refactoring, point the cursor to any occurrence of this variable, then select
		<em> Rename Variable... </em> from the <em> Refactor </em>menu, after that, 
		Wrangler will ask you for the new name.</p>
		<p><b>Shortcut:</b></p><code> SHIFT+ALT+R V </code>
		
	<h2><a name="Rename function">Rename function</a></h2>
		Rename a function with a new name supplied by the user.
		<p> When renaming an exported function, this refactoring has a global effect, that is, 
		it affects all those modules in which this function is imported/used.</p>
		
		<p> The following <em> side-conditions </em> (or <em>pre-conditions </em>}  apply to this refactoring:</p>
		<ul>
		<li> The new function name should not cause confliction with any of the functions which are in scope in the 
		current module;</li>
		<li> In the case that the function to be renamed is imported by another module, the new function name (with the same 
		arity) should not be already in scope (either defined or imported) in that module. </li>
		</ul>
		<p> <b>Usage:</b> to apply this refactoring, point the cursor to any occurrence of this 
		function name, then select <em> Rename Function... </em> from the <em> Refactor </em> menu, 
		after that, Wrangler will ask you for the function"s new name.</p>
		<p><b>Shortcut:</b></p><code> SHIFT+ALT+R F </code>
		
	<h2><a name="Rename module">Rename module</a></h2>
		Rename a module with a new name supplied by the user.
		<p> This refactoring affects all those modules in which the module name is used.</p>
		
	 	<p>The following <em> side-conditions </em> apply to this refactoring:</p>
	 	<ul>
		<li> The new module name should not have been used as a module name in the program under consideration. </li>
		<li> This refactoring assume that the file basename is always the same as the module name, therefore this 
	 	refactoring changes the filename as well. </li>
	 	</ul>
		<p> <b>Usage:</b> to apply this refactoring, point the cursor anywhere in the module to be renamed, then select 
		<em> Rename Module... </em> from the <em> Refactor </em> menu, after that, the refactorer will prompt to enter 
		the new module name.</p>
		<p><b>Shortcut:</b></p><code> SHIFT+ALT+R M </code>
	
	<h2><a name="Move function">Move function</a></h2>
		Move a function definition from its current module to another.
		<p> This refactoring has a global effect, i.e., it affects all the modules - in the project - in which 
		the function is imported/used.</p>
		
		<p> This refactoring assumes that an Erlang module name always matches its file name.</p>
		
		<p> Suppose we move function <em> foo/n </em> from its current module <em> M </em> 
		to module <em> N </em>, then the following <em> side-conditions </em> apply to 
		this refactoring:</p> 
		<ul>
		<li> If <em> foo/n </em> is already in scope in module <em> N </em>, then its defining 
		module should be  <em> M </em>.</li>
		<li> Function <em> foo/n </em> should not contain any uses of <em> implicit fun expressions </em> (Note: move a 
		collection of functions together to another module will be supported by another refactoring).</li>
		</ul>
		<p> <b>Usage</b>: to apply this refactoring, point the cursor at the function definition, then 
		select <em> Move function...</em> from the <em> Refactor </em> menu, 
		Wrangler will ask you to select one of the existing modules. </p>
		<p><b>Shortcut:</b></p><code> SHIFT+ALT+M </code>
	
	<h2><a name="Fold expression">Fold expression</a></h2>
		Fold expressions against a function definition.
		<p>This refactoring replaces instances of the right-hand side of a function clause definition by
		the corresponding left-hand side with necessary parameter substitutions.</p>
		
		<p> In the case that a candidate expression/expression sequence  needs to export some variables which 
		are used by the code following code, that expression/expression sequence will be replaced by a match 
		expression, whose left-hand side it the exported variable(s), and right-hand side is the function
		application.</p>
		
		<p> This refactoring does not support folding against function clauses with guard expressions, or 
		function clauses with complex formal parameters, such as tuples, lists, or records. </p>
		
		<p> <b>Usage</b>: first point the cursor to the function clause against which expressions will be 
		folded if the function is defined in the current module, then select <em> Fold expression... </em> 
		from the <em> Refactor </em> menu; after that Wrangler will search the current module for expressions 
		which are instances of the right-hand side of the selected function clause.</p>
		
		<p> If no candidate expression has been found, a message will be given, and the refactoring 
		finishes; otherwise you a wizard window appears and you can select those expressions which would like to be folded.
		For the smarter usage in this stage of the process moving the cursor above the selectable expressions - in the dialog window - 
		they are highlighted in the background on by one.</p>
	
	<h2><a name="Function extraction">Function extraction</a></h2>
		Introduce a new function to represent an expression or expression sequence.
		<p> This refactoring allows the user to introduce a new function to represent a selected expression or expression 
		sequence, and replace the selected code with a call to the new function.  Free variables
		within the selected code become the formal parameters of the function definition.</p>
		<p>	<b>Usage</b>: highlight the expression/expression sequence of interest, then selected the <em>Function extraction...</em> 
		from the <em>Refactor</em> menu, Wrangler will then ask you for the new function name.
		</p>
	
	<h2><a name="Generalise function">Generalise function</a></h2>
		<p>Generalise a function definition by selecting a sub-expression of its right-hand 
		side and making this the value of a new argument added to the definition of the function. 
		The sub-expression becomes the actual parameter at the call sites. </p>
		
		<p> Here is an example of generalisation, in which the function <code> add_one </code> defined 
		on the left-hand side is generalised on the expression <code> 1 </code>, and the result is 
		shown on the right-hand side.</p> 
		<pre><code>	
		       ```    -module (test).                          -module (test). 
		              -export([f/1]).                          -export([f/1]).
		       
		              add_one ([H|T]) ->                       add_one (N, [H|T]) ->
		                 [H+1 | add_one(T)];                      [H+N | add_one(N,T)];
		              add_one ([]) -> [].                      add_one (N, []) -> [].
		
		              f(X) -> add_one(X).                      f(X) -> add_one(1,X)
		       ''' 
		</code></pre>
		
		<p> In the case that the selected expression has a side-effect, the refactorer will wrap this expression 
		in an function expression before passing it as the actual parameter to the call-sites. This is illustrated 
		in the following example, in which function <code>repeat/1</code> is generalised on the expression 
		<code>io:format("Hello\n")</code>.</p>
		<pre><code>
		```   -module (test).                          -module (test).                          
		      -export([f/0]).                          -export([f/0]).
		
		      repeat(0) -> ok;                         repeat(A, 0) -> ok;
		      repeat(N) ->                             repeat(A, N) ->
		      io:format("Hello\n"),                    A( ),
		      repeat(N-1).                             repeat(A,N-1).
		
		      f() -> repeat(5).                        f( ) -> 
		                                                   repeat (fun( )->io:format ("Hello\n") end, 5).
		'''
		</code></pre>
		
		<p> This refactoring <em>only </em> affects the module in which the refactoring is initialised. In the case that 
		the generalised function is exported by the module, an auxiliary function will be created 
		to wrap the generalised function up, so that the module's interface is not changed.
		</p>
		<p> The following <em> side-conditions </em> apply to this refactoring:</p>
		<ul>
		<li> Suppose the function to be generalised is <code>foo/n </code>, then <code>foo/n+1</code> should not  
		be in scope before the generalisation;</li>
		<li> The new parameter name provided by the user should not conflict with the existing parameters or
		change the semantics of the function to be generalised. </li>
		</ul>
		<p> <b>Usage</b>: to apply this refactoring, highlight the expression first, then  select 
		<em> Generalise function... </em> from the <em>Refactor</em> menu, after 
		that the refactorer will ask for the new name. </p>

	
	<h2><a name="Tuple function parameters">Tuple function parameters</a></h2>
		Turn some consecutive parameters of a function into a tuple parameter.
		<p>When the function under consideration is exported by the module where it is defined, 
		this refactoring has a global effect. </p>
		
		<p> Suppose the new function after refactoring is <code>f/n</code>, then the following <em> side-conditions </em> apply:</p>
		<ul>
		<li> <code> f/n</code> should not cause confliction with any of the functions which are in scope in the 
		current module;</li>
		<li> In the case that the function is imported by another module, then <code>f/n</code> 
		should not be already in scope (either defined or imported) in that module. </li>
		</ul>
		<p> <b>Usage</b>: to apply this refactoring, point the cursor to the parameter which is going to be the first 
		element of the tuple, then select <em> Tuple function parameters... </em> from the <em> Refactor </em> menu, 
		after that, Wrangler will ask you to enter the number of parameters to include into the tuple.
