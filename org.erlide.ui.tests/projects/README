In this directory add test projects that can be imported in a workspace 
and tests can be run on them.

The goal is to have a set of projects that depend on each other and recreate
the most complex settings at user's site, including use of external_modules 
and external_includes.

This way we don't need to rely on testing at in a Shade environment.
