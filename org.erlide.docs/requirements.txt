Erlide requirements
===================

Overview
--------

We need to capture the functionality implemented by erlide in a structured manner, 
so that we can convert them into tests. Here we only refer to functionality 
visible to the user.

We define requirements in terms of the syntactic context surrounding the location 
of the cursor (marked | below). More specific context take precedence over more 
general ones. 

#. 	The result list is sorted so that recently used matches are placed first. 
	The order is otherwise accorting to relevance to the context. 
   
	* matching is case insensitive
	* a match is defined by 
		- an exact match of the pattern at the beginning or inside the result
		- "underscore match" where for example ``g_tr_co`` matches ``get_tree_content``; 
			each underscore delimited part must be a prefix of the corresponding 
			part in the result; the parts specified in the pattern must be contiguous;
			at the end there may be more underscores than in the pattern
	* exact matches at the beginning are ranked before matches inside the text
	* the relative sorting of the different lexical categories is not specified (yet)
	
#. 	Context: ``--empty--``

	Result: everything that can be matched
	
#. 	Context: ``atom|``

	Result: 

#. 	Context: ``?atom|``

	Result: 

#. 	Context: ``term:atom|``, where term may be atom or macro

	Result:
