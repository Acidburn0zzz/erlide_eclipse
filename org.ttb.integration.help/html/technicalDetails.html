<h2>Technical details</h2>
<h3>Ttb</h3>
This plugin uses an improved version of ttb (Trace Tool Builder,
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/ttb.html">http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/ttb.html</a>
) for tracing purposes. "Improved" means that this version is currently not included in OTP and
comes as part of this plugin. This version is called here "ttbe" ("e" stands for "extended").
<br />
Ttb is built on top of
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/dbg.html">dbg</a>
and provides some improvements which makes tracing easier. This plugin provides graphical user
interface to ttb which makes using it more user friendly.

<h3>Tracing</h3>
Ttb is started on separate erlang node called "tracing" (
<code>-sname tracing</code>
). It allows tracing tool to be independent from node you want to trace. "Tracing" node is
automatically started by erlide when any tracing action is performed for the first time (tracing
another node or loading trace data from file).
<br />
Traced node is treated as "diskless node", i.e. all data from this node is directly sent to the
"tracing" node. After finishing tracing all data is writen to the directory named
<i>ttb_upload_erlide_tracing-Timestamp</i>
(
<i>Timestamp</i>
is in a form of yyyymmdd-hhmmss) into file called
<i>nodeName@hostName</i>
.

<br />
When tracing is finished application reads data from this file using special data handler
provided to
<code>ttbe:format/2</code>
function which, instead of formatting data, sends it directly to trace plugin which interprets it.
<br />Same action is performed when reading trace results from file.
