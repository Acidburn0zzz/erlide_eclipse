<h3>What is tracing?</h3>
<p><em>"In software engineering, tracing is a specialized use of logging to record
information about a program's execution. This information is typically used by programmers for
debugging purposes, and additionally, depending on the type and detail of information contained in a
trace log, by experienced system administrators or technical support personnel to diagnose common
problems with software."</em> <br>

<p>Tracing is a specific kind of event logging - it logs "low level" information. Because of
that user quickly gets overwhelmed with logged data and finds it rather difficult to browse it. This
plugin also profides an user friedly way of browsing trace results - they are displayed in a form of
a tree where each event is represented by different type of icon. Tree nodes can be unfolded to get
more details about particular event.</p>
