List of user visible changes between 0.5.0 and 0.5.1 (r2293)

	added automated problem report if backend dies with exit code != 0

	at startup, if no runtime is defined, search "obvious" locations and add all found runtimes. The newest will be set as default. 

	ensuring that the ide backend exists (else print error messages as soon as possible)

	OTP R13-version of JInterface

	http://www.assembla.com/spaces/erlide/tickets/275-Indent----end--and-indent-after-newline

	made build backends transitory, in multi-user environment they take a lot of space

	changed project properties to use a minimum required runtime version instead of a hardcoded runtime name

	http://www.assembla.com/spaces/erlide/tickets/286-quick-outline---doesn-t-work-with-external-modules

	added Eclipse+Erlang launch configuration, to be used when debugging erlide itself

List of user visible changes between 0.4.3 and 0.5.0

	Added external include path settings file for erlang projects
	(just like external modules file)

	fixed bug when build backend was called "erlide"

	Indentation uses tabs, indents only affected functions, and is
	cleaned up a bit

	fixes around backend startup and ide backend

    Fixed autocompletion so that external modules can be completed
      
    Fixed a slight oversight when accessing external files (it should be
	created and have the erlang nature)

	Added error marker if a file could not be compiled at all
	(compiler crashed or no backend)

    Auto-completion didn't work when both default_external_modules and
	external_modules were specified (open did the right thing).

	http://www.assembla.com/spaces/erlide/tickets/214: updated jinterface to R12

	optimized RPC performance by caching call signatures

	New, fancier, better, smarter reconciler!
	  - Scans all changes after one delay
	  - Parses after all changes, not for each one of them (no more
	  shuffling after undo or find/replace)
	  - Method to reconcile without delay and wait for it, so model is
	  up-to-date, e.g. for model commands like Completion or Open

	Small improvement of dirty region handling, works better with
	  backspace

	Autoindent now also uses tabs

	Honour the Preferences -> General / Editors / Text Editors /
	  Insert spaces for tabs checkbox, when indenting, if it's checked,
	  use only spaces.

	Restored reset handling in reconciler, so it doesn't reconcile
	  during lengthy typing, but afterwards

	added runtimeVersion project preference, to allow not specifying
	  a runtime name (that are user specific)
